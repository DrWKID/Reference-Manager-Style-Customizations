This will import the Vancouver reference style with modifications that include DOI, PMID, and PMCID when available in your reference manager. It also removes parentheses from the body text references and makes the numerical reference superscript.

This might work: Install your reference manager web browser extension (e.g., Chrome Zotero Connector). When you load this page, the extension should ask if you'd like to import this format. It will then import to your referenc emanager style choices. Then select "Vancouver". If you already have a style implemented, please remember to hit "refresh" on your bibliography to update the document. It make take a few minutes depending on how many references you have. 

Alternatively, download the reference style and then through your reference manager, manually load this as a style.
